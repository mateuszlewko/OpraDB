Parser:
    ✔ Add conversion from `RegExpTail` to `RegularExpression` @done(17-12-10 03:45)
    ✔ Handle whitespaces in regular expression parsing @done(17-12-10 14:09)
    ✔ Test query parsing @done(17-12-10 15:59)
    ❑ Improve syntax (possibly use FsLex and FsYacc)
    ❑ Add node constraint which returns bool (only one operand in expression) or add bool value @low
    ❑ Parse complex node constraints
    ❑ Parse arithmetic constraints
    ❑ Parse ontologies


Query execution:
    ✔ Build NFA @done(17-12-18 23:16)
