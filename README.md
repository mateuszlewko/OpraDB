# OpraDB

OpraDB is graph database that uses [OPRA query language](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.04419) and is written in [F#](http://fsharp.org/).
Main purpose of this project is to show the expressive power of [OPRA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.04419.pdf) queries.

Ability to express complex path properties in a modular
way and with a minimum effort, is where this query language really excels.

**Note:** Although this is a work in progress, usable version is already available.

## How to write Opra queries

Read this sections to get a brief understanding of [Opra QL](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.04419.pdf) and OpraDB.

### Basics

#### Graph

Let's start by defining OpraDB graph. Graph consists of directed edges and nodes.
Each node and edge can have a set of properties. Property has a:

* key `string`
* value of one of the following types: `string`, `int`, `bool`, `float`.

Undirected graphs can be represented by adding two directed edges for each undirected edge,
in both directions.

Example graph in `json` format:

```json
{
    "nodes": [
        { "_id": 1, "crowd": 2, "start": 1 }
      , { "_id": 2, "crowd": 10 }
    ],
    "directed_edges": [
        { "_from": 1, "_to": 2, "dist": 3 }
      , { "_from": 2, "_to": 1, "dist": 3 }
    ]
}
```

**Note:** All nodes must have field `_id` with *positive* integer value. Edges
must have `_from` and `_to` properties, which point to node ids *already defined*
in `nodes` object (see example above).

#### Syntax

Query has following syntax:

```cypher
MATCH NODES <list of matched (returned) nodes or node properties>
      PATHS <list of matched paths>
      SUCH THAT <path constraints>
      WHERE <regular constraints>
      HAVING <arithmetic constraints>
```

`MATCH`, `NODES`, `PATHS`, `SUCH THAT`, `WHERE` and `HAVING` are most used
keywords and they all must be uppercase. When creating a query you should always
specify at least one matched node or node property.

**Note:** Returning matched paths is currently **not supported**.

- List of matched nodes (`MATCH NODES`):

    Example:

    ```cypher
    MATCH NODES a, b, someNode, property(someNode), name(someNode)
    ...
    ```
    By specifying node or node's property in matched nodes, we're essentially
    defining an alias to this node, which we can use in latter constraints.

    Usually we want to return node's property like `name(x)`. Providing just an
    alias `x` will return ids of all nodes that matched `x`'s constraints.

- `MATCH ... PATHS`:
    Behaviour for matching paths is similar to nodes, however current versions
    doesn't return paths.

### Constraints

#### Path constraints

```cypher
path1 : beginNode -> endNode
```

Path constraints are here to specify that there is path called `path1` from node
`beginNode` to `endNode`. Both nodes could be bound earlier in *matched nodes list*,
but they don't have to be. In case a node wasn't bound earlier, it will be existentially quantified (meaning that is just needs to exists). This rule applies for all occurrences of nodes or paths not bound in `MATCH ...` list.

Multiple path constraints can be specified in query by separating them with comma.

Example:

```cypher
MATCH NODES name(a), name(b), name(c)
SUCH THAT p: a -> b, q: a -> c
```

#### Node and regular constraints

Regular constraint specifies how correct paths should look like. It consists of
node constraints and operators: `|`, `*`. Each node constraint describes one of the nodes on a given path.

Example node constrains:

- `(access_level(people) > 3 OR position(people) = "CTO")` this constraint will be     true if *current* node on path `people` has property `access_level` that is
  greater
  than 3 or property `position` is "CTO"

*Current node* is currently checked node when traversing a path.

- `(distance(cities, 'cities) < 10)` Tick before node name (`'node`) is current node's
  successor when traversing a path. Node will satisfy this constraint, if outgoing edge (to successor) has property `distance` and its values is less than 10.

Regular constraint can just be a sequence of node constraints, like this:

```cypher
(name(friends) = "Bol")(name(friends) = "Alice")(name(friends) = "Mateusz")
```

Path `friends` satisfies this constraint as long as it contains three nodes which
are connected by some edges, and `name` of first node is *Bob*, second *Alice* and
third *Mateusz*.

However, regular constraints can act as regular expression on paths, where instead
of letters and digits we have *node constraints*. This is where we can make use of
union `|` and Kleene-star `*` operators.

#### Regular constraint as regular expression for path

Following query returns pairs of cities in Poland and USA for which
there exists flight path:

```cypher
MATCH NODES x, y
SUCH THAT p: x -> y
WHERE (country(p) = "Poland").*(country(p) = "USA"),
      (flight(p, 'p) IS NOT NULL)*.
```

Expression `(<node constraint>)*` will be satisfied by sequence of nodes on a path,
of any length (possibly zero). Dot `.` means that any node will match this
constraint.

In above query we have two regular constraints.
First checks that path begins and ends in appropriate countries, however, we can
flight through any country (hence `.*`). Second, ensures that there exists a flight
connection between consecutive nodes.

**Note:** Dot at the end (match any) is necessary, because when checking the constraint
for last node on a path, we don't need to ensure that there is a property `flight`
on edge outgoing from last node (there may not be).

In next example let's that we want to travel from Poland to USA only through specific countries:

```cypher
MATCH NODES x, y
SUCH THAT p: x -> y
WHERE (country(p) = "Poland")((country(p) = "Canada") | (country(p) = "Germany"))*
(country(p) = "USA"), (flight(p, 'p) IS NOT NULL)*.
```

#### Arithmetic constraints

In order to constrain arithmetic properties of paths, you can use following
keywords: `SUM`, `MAX`, `MIN`. They will perform aggregated operation on nodes or
edges. Then they can be compared to other aggregated operations or constants inside
`HAVING` clause.

Example:

```cypher
MATCH NODES x, y
SUCH THAT p: x -> y
WHERE (country(p) = "Poland").*(country(p) = "USA"),
      (flight(p, 'p) IS NOT NULL)*.
HAVING SUM (dist(p)) < 8000, MAX (duration(p, 'p)) <= 6
```

This will constrain length of trip from Poland to USA, to be shorter than 8000 km 
and make sure none of the flights exceeds 6 hours.

Following query ensures that return trip will be shorter than the first one:

```cypher
MATCH NODES x, y
SUCH THAT p: x -> y, q: y -> x
WHERE (country(p) = "Poland").*(country(p) = "USA"),
      (flight(p, 'p) IS NOT NULL)*.
HAVING SUM (dist(p)) < 8000, SUM (dist(q)) < SUM (dist(p))
```

### Let expression (Ontologies)

TODO: explanation, query examples

### Handling cycles

As arithmetic constraints can be quite complicated and they can be applied on
graphs with positive and negative cycles, OpraDB uses following algorithm to check whether paths satisfy these constraints:

1. First all paths that satisfy regular constraints are found.
2. For each path, we retrieve all simple cycles (using Johnson's algorithm) and
   calculate delta value of each property (that exists in arithmetic constrains).
3. With all aggregated values for every property and delta of property values
   for each cycle, we construct a set of linear inequalities, that includes variables representing number of times to traverse a given cycle.
4. We solve this set of inequalities using [Z3](TODO:link) solver to find out
   how many times to traverse each cycle. If no positive solutions where found it means that path doesn't satisfy arithmetic constraints.

I'll compare these graph query languages on [air routes](TODO:link) dataset.

TODO: Mention that OpraDB also supports graphml data format

TODO: comparison, queries in both languages
